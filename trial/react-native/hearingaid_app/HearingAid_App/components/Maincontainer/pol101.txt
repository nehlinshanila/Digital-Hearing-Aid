As India's job bandwagon picks up, IT sector falls off pace: DBS report. Synopsis
A slowdown in consumer demand post the pandemic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions triggered mass layoffs across Big Tech firms over the past few months - including in companies like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In India, Reliance Industries was the latest to hand out pink slips, with its online wholesale format JioMart laying off more than 1,000 employees, with more jobs cuts expected.
"Unemployment rates have fallen sharply since the mid-pandemic highs. March-April '23 rates are up a touch, with urban a shade more than rural, likely a reflection of the pick-up in the Labour Participation rate (LPR)," the report said.

Exports shrink 12.7% in April, trade deficit hits 20-month low at $15.2 billion. Synopsis
India's exports fell for the third consecutive month, shrinking 12.7% YoY to $34.66bn in April 2023. The decline was affected by slow demand and a recession in leading markets. The trade deficit fell to $15.2bn in April, recording a 20-month low due to falling oil prices. Although the demand scenario for Europe and the US was not optimistic in the short term, officials expected an increase in demand over the next few months.

The Water Wars Myth: India, China and the Brahmaputra. South Asia’s Brahmaputra has been cited as one of the basins most at risk for interstate water conflict. While violent conflict has occurred between China and India within the Brahmaputra’s basin boundaries, the risks of conflict over water are in fact low. This is in part because China functionally contributes less to the Brahmaputra’s flow than is commonly perceived and in part because, despite its massive volume, the river can contribute little to solving India’s significant water security challenges. Nonetheless, the Brahmaputra is and will continue to be intimately connected to Sino-Indian tensions largely through the use of water infrastructure investment as a form of territorial demarcation and control.

Reviving private charitable hospitals in India: A solution to the healthcare crisis. The Indian Healthcare system has made significant strides since the 1970s. The life expectancy at birth has increased from 47.7 years in the 1970s to about 70.4 years in 2023. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and infant mortality ratio (IMR) have also dropped substantially. However, there is a flip side to this success story as well and that is the lack of government spending in recent years on healthcare. Government spending on healthcare as a percentage of GDP fell to an abysmal 1.05% in 2015-16 from 1.47% in the late 1980s. Lately, there has been an upward trend in this spending, but still, according to WHO, India is one of the countries with the lowest public spending in the healthcare sector. In 2021-22, 48.2% of the total healthcare expenditure was paid out of pocket in India which is a good decline from 67.78% in 2017. However, at the same time around the world, the same stood at 18.2%! Therefore, one cannot help but think that this development in public healthcare is ‘development only for the rich.’
