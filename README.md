## Digital Hearing Aid :ear_with_hearing_aid:

  Our project is an app for those people that are both autistic and have hearing aid disability. The app takes sound input and will then process and amplify the sound according to the user’s need. Every hearing loss is different which is why the doctor will specify the highest and lowest decibel of sound tolerated by that specific patient and it will be set inside the app accordingly. 
  
  The app will also detect loud sounds and optimize it to a lower level for the user based on their specific range. After the sound enters the app, it is then amplified as well as the high amplitude sounds are suppressed and brought down to an optimum level for the user so that it doesn’t affect their hearing loss further. This app is also suitable for those that works in high noise environment like construction as noise reduction is one of our app’s features.

  This is not entirely a new idea and it’s counterpart, which is a normal hearing aid usually just amplifies the entire sound it captures. But this module/app gets the audio processes it and then sends it to the amplifier. At present a lot of apps, modules and data-models have been made to solve the issue but none have been implemented and on production level. 
  
  The problem with this kind of signal processing is that it takes a lot of processing speed to process a large amount of data in a short amount of time. Normal mobiles and hearing aid devices don’t render that much processing power so there are very few ways to execute the process. So, either there should be more processing with less hardware implementations or there are more hardware implementations and less processing. There is room for both, and each has their individual needs. Some can be controlled by the hardware easily where some need the software to process.
  
  The limitations for this project were technological advancement and lack of hardware and signal processing knowledge. We still could not solve the noise cancellation issue. It can only be solved by the hardware part where the “Active Noise Cancellation” tool can be used for better efficiency. Other than that, there are not many issues. 
  
  The module has been tested by multiple people not with hearing disabilities, because we did not have right to the engineering of hearing-aid device and for that we could not test on real patients. But the volunteers that tried this app using their headphones/earbuds noise cancellation features provided good feedback.
