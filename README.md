## Overview

Our project is an app for those people that are both autistic and have hearing aid disability. The app takes sound input and will then process and amplify the sound according to the user’s need. Every hearing loss is different which is why the doctor will specify the highest and lowest decibel of sound tolerated by that specific patient and it will be set inside the app accordingly.

The app will also detect loud sounds and optimize it to a lower level for the user based on their specific range. After the sound enters the app, it is then amplified as well as the high amplitude sounds are suppressed and brought down to an optimum level for the user so that it doesn’t affect their hearing loss further. This app is also suitable for those that works in high noise environment like construction as noise reduction is one of our app’s features.

## Key Features

- **Custom Sound Processing**: The app processes incoming sounds and optimizes loud sounds by reducing them to a lower level within the user's specific comfort range. It also suppresses high amplitude sounds to prevent further hearing loss.
- **Noise Reduction**: This feature is especially beneficial for users in high-noise environments such as construction sites, aiding in clearer sound reception.
- **User-Centric Design**: Tailored for both autistic individuals and those with hearing impairments, accommodating their specific auditory needs.

## Application Details

This app involves sophisticated signal processing that requires significant computing power, more than what normal mobile devices and hearing aids typically provide. Hence, our approach combines advanced software algorithms with minimal hardware dependency, allowing for a balance between performance and usability.

### Technological Limitations

The primary challenges have been in advancing noise cancellation technology within the constraints of current hardware capabilities. While the software efficiently handles various sound processing tasks, the hardware-focused 'Active Noise Cancellation' remains a development goal.

### Testing and Feedback

The application has undergone extensive testing by individuals without hearing impairments due to ethical considerations in using real patients. Feedback from users who tested the application using headphones and earbuds with noise cancellation features has been overwhelmingly positive.
